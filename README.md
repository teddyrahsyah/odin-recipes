# 🍽️ Simple Recipes Website

This is a beginner-friendly HTML project featuring a simple recipes website. It includes a home page with links to individual recipe pages such as Chicken Shawarma, Rendang, and Nasi Goreng.

This project is part of my learning journey through [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), focused on mastering the basics of HTML structure and content organization.
