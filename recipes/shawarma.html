    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This chicken shawarma is made with flavorful chicken thighs marinated in a spiced yogurt. Slice the cooked
        chicken and serve in pita bread with tomato, sliced onion, and my homemade tahini sauce for a popular Middle
        Eastern sandwich.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>

            pepper together in a glass baking dish.</li>

            refrigerate.</li>
        <li>Cover the chicken and bake in the marinade for 30 minutes, turning once. Uncover, and cook for an additional
            5 to 10 minutes, or until chicken is browned and cooked through.</li>
